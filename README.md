ðŸš€ Overview

Wyhash is a fast, high-quality, portable non-cryptographic hash function known for its exceptional speed and randomness quality. 
This repository provides a native Zig implementation of Wyhash.Project is also open for people to add to and improve. Please check the issues to view requested features


Why Wyhash?

âœ… Extremely fast performance across different architectures
âœ… High-quality randomness and strong avalanche effect
âœ… Minimal code size and efficient memory usage
âœ… Used in databases, networking, and high-performance applications



# ðŸ›  Basic Usage

```zig
const wyhash = @import("wyhash");
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const r: u64 = 0x001020120;

    const res = wyhash._whash("ðŸ”¥Hello World!", r);
    std.debug.print("wyhash(\"ðŸ”¥Hello World!\", {}) = {}\n", .{ r, res });
}

```

# ðŸ“¦ Installation

*Add this to your build.zig.zon*

```zig
.dependencies = .{
    .wyhash = .{
        .url = "https://github.com/NikoMalik/wyhash/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz",
        //the correct hash will be suggested by zig
    }
}

```

*And add this to you build.zig*

```zig
    const wyhash = b.dependency("wyhash", .{
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
    });
    exe_mod.addImport("wyhash", wyhash.module("wyhash"));


```

#  ðŸ“¦ Installation/2

```bash

git clone https://github.com/NikoMalik/wyhash.git
mv wyhash /path/to/your/project/directory
```



You can then import the library into your code like this

```zig
const wyhash = @import("wyhash")
```



# ðŸ”¥ Benchmarks

Wyhash is one of the fastest hash functions available. Benchmarks against MurmurHash3, XXHash, and CityHash show superior performance in most cases.
